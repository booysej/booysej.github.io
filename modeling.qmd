## Renewable Energy Forecasting

#### Solar PV

-   Solar Potential exploratory tool developed in DIAS (In house R shiny framework - before R shiny existed)

## Eskom Geo Based Load Forecasting

#### Domestic Building Density per LSM Estimates South Africa

Linked big and complex spatial data in Oracle Spatial, and developed a spatial filtering algorithm to exclude public spaces.

*Filter out public space areas with open street map layers. Use spatial buffering algorithm below to further filter out public space. Find Nearest Neighbour (NN) distances distribution of all the buildings in each enumeration area. Finding nearest neighbour for 11,310,724 buildings in 80 000 areas. Buffer width = mean(NN) + 1.96 stddev (95th)*

*Draw Buffers around each building (red) merging into each other. Filter out buildings with nearest neighbour distances \> mean(NN) + 2 stddev. New area size (red) is more robust and proved to exclude public space undetected before.*Â
