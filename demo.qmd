-   Calculate the historic 15min renewable Solar PV and Wind profiles from 2015 - 2020 using ERA5 and CAMS irradiance with power output models for all 80237 generator locations and compare the aggregate to the country wide stats from transparency.entsoe.eu

-   Use NWP models applied to all 80237 generator locations to do a day ahead country wide forecast

    -   Compare that forecast to the transparency.entsoe.eu forecast

-   Detect Domestic rooftop solar installations from satellite images and do a domestic demand forecast per 6 digit postal code
