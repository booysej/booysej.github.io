I am responsible for helping utilities and other companies interpret and manage data and solve complex problems using expertise in a variety of data niches often employing computer science, server-less cloud computing , machine learning, optimisation, modelling, statistics and advanced visualisations.\nI have been involved in the development of Geo-based load sub classes , a market intelligence system with sentiment analysis using machine learning and integrated resource least-cost planning for energy trading market analysis on the Southern African Power Pool, including the impact of climate change models on this. I have produced day ahead hourly renewable forecasting models for IPP’s. Solutions were developed using R, Python, specialised software and tableau.\nCurrently I am the technical lead in the disruptive innovation business unit at enerweb, I provide Data Science as a service on the Python based in house SaaS technology stack enerflow. We use AWS micro services architecture and a custom framework i developed that runs on top of Apache Airflow making use of AWS Lambda and allowing you to run Jupiter notebooks in the cloud from MS Excel. My strength lies in the ability to do rapid prototyping because of my strong software engineering background, and my passion for machine learning and constantly improving doing things a better way."
