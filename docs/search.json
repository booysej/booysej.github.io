    "text": "As a Senior Data Scientist at Enerweb in Johannesburg, South Africa, I have a passion for problem solving and software engineering, using a variety of data niches including machine learning, optimization, and advanced visualizations.\nMy experience includes developing various data science solutions for the energy industry including renewable energy forecasting models and interactive tools using global circulation models and historic satellite data, as well as creating frameworks for providing Data Science as a Service on a Python-based SaaS technology stack. I excel in rapid prototyping and problem visualization to get the stakeholders involved, where after i get the model or solution into production using CICD and DEVOPS principles. I constantly strive for improvement.\nMy skills include time series forecasting, machine learning, optimization, renewable energy, R (including Shiny), Python, AWS, K8S, Airflow, DEVOPS and rapid prototyping. Outside of work, I enjoy adventure racing, ultra trail running, and mountain sports. #DataScience #MachineLearning #AWS #RenewableEnergy #Python #R #EnergyModelling #MonteCarloSimulation #SpatialData #DisruptiveInnovation"
