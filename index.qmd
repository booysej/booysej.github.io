## Bio

I am a scientist at heart, passionate about data science and with over 10 years experience in the electricity load research field, I am responsible for helping utilities and other companies interpret and manage data and solve complex problems using expertise in a variety of data niches often employing computer science, machine learning, modelling, statistics and advanced visualizations. 

I have been involved in the development of Geo-based load subclasses, a market intelligence system with sentiment analysis using machine learning and integrated resource least-cost planning for energy trading market analysis including the impact of climate change models on this. Recently I have produced day ahead hourly renewable forecasting models for IPP's.
