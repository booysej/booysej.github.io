## Bio

As a Senior Data Scientist at Enerweb in Johannesburg, South Africa, I have a passion for problem solving and software engineering, using a variety of data niches including machine learning, optimization, and advanced visualizations.

My expertise includes developing renewable energy forecasting models and interactive tools using global circulation models and historic satellite data, as well as creating frameworks for providing Data Science as a Service on a Python-based SaaS technology stack named Enerflow. With experience in AWS microservices architecture, Apache Airflow, and running Jupyter notebooks in the cloud from MS Excel, I excel in rapid prototyping and constantly strive for improvement.

My skills include AWS/Cloud, machine learning, renewable energy, R and Python, and rapid prototyping. Outside of work, I enjoy adventure racing, ultra trail running, and mountain sports. **#DataScience #MachineLearning #AWS #RenewableEnergy #Python #EnergyModelling #MonteCarloSimulation #SpatialData #DisruptiveInnovation**
